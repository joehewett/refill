Attention Charlie Holmes

It's a great news to inform you that your total fund worth US$10,700,000.00
(Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) has been programmed in our
system the way it will be transfer into your bank account However Your fund
is at the verge of transferring to you but before we carry out the transfer
of the fund to your provided bank account, the Management and the Board of
Directors of the bank made it mandatory that you will have to pay for the
cost of transfer (C.O.T) which is the transferring policy and law for all
foreign payment in every Bank world wide.

To this end, the Transfer charge of your fund will cost you the sum of $750
only and this payment will be made before we effect the transfer of your
fund and thereafter the fund transfer confirmation slip will be issued to
you by this bank which you will use to confirm your fund in your account as
soon as your fund is transfer your bank account

Also be informed that this fund will only take 24 hours to drop into your
Bank Account as soon as everything is settled, Also note that as soon as we
make the transfer, we will send you the 14 digit Code with a transfer slip
which you must use to confirm your fund in your account within 24 hours.

Please understand that this is the procedure as we cannot process such huge
such of money and release it for transfer to your account without following
due process and without your meeting your required obligations.You are
required and advised to follow our advice for a smooth operation and you
receive your money without hitches so I will urge you to do your best and
send the required fee so we can commence on your transfer immediately

JP Morgan Chase Bank hereby states officially that the required payment
will remain the only and final monetary obligation required from you prior
to the final release and transfer of your funds, hence any further charges
will be our bank's full responsibility till the fund is finally transferred
into your bank account.

We shall proceed with your transaction once you send the money.The Account
details to use for the payment of $750.00 is below:

Account HOLDER Name: CHRISTINA A GALLO
Bank Name: Chase Bank
Account Number: 474477929
Swift Code: Chasus33
Bank Address: 3492 Mt. Diablo Blvd Lafayette, Ca 94549 U.S.A
Amount $750.00

Once again: the reason why we need you to send us the $750,00 is that we
tried to deduct the transfer fee from your fund but the minister
administrator trust fund of United States told us that no one has access
over your fund as it have been signed and stamped that no money should be
deducted until it gets to you to avoid any misunderstanding because if
anyone has access to that it will involve you losing your fund,

N/B.:Be well known that your funds have been "legally bonded and insured'',
so because of this insurance policy the bank or any of our officials have
no legal authority to deduct or add to the value of your funds. I will
advice you to comply with our directives so that we can be able to finalize
this transfer without any hitches

Thank you for your understanding and I will be waiting to hear from you

Regards
Mr.Stephen Westwood
Chief Executive Officer Director Jp Morgan Chase Bank
